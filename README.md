## The tech stacks we use :books:	
* __Retrofit__ handles API requests
* __Glide library__ loads image resources with ease
* __Room__ persistent database
* __Internal sensor__ pedometer for step counter
* __Google Maps API__ for intuitive location, direction and distance
* __MVVM architecture__ LiveData/ViewModel, data binding
* __SharedPreferences__ stores data locally
* __Coroutines__ runs background tasks
* __Navigation Component__ for navigation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## *** Note ***
Setup before running app:
* In gradle.properties file, replace your google map API key
```
MY_API_KEY="REPLACE YOUR API KEY HERE"
```
* Make sure you grant the app permissions to use Network and Location services.
